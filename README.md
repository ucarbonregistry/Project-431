The Project Titled “3.0 MW Bundled Small Scale Wind Power Project by M/s Energy
Development Company Limited” is a Wind based Power Project successfully commissioned by
Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) and Chitradurga K73 operational
since 30/09/2008 and Hassan H25 operational since 27/09/2007. The Project is owned by M/s
Energy Development Company Limited (hereby to be called as Project Proponent, PP).

The purpose of the project activity is to utilize renewable wind energy for generation of electricity.
The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG’s) into the
atmosphere, by displacing the equivalent amount of electricity generation through the operation of
existing fuel fossil fuel-based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the grid. In
the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated
from the fossil fuel-based power plant. Whereas the electricity generation from operation of Wind
Energy Convertors (WEC’s) is emission free. 

Commissioning dates of the Wind Turbine Generators installed are shown in the below table:

Sr. No./ RR. No/ No./ Capacity /Commissioning Date

2 /(Chitradurga K73)/ ELP - 10/ 1 /1500 kW/ 30/09/2008

The project will generate approximately 5,493MWh of electricity per annum. The net generated
electricity from the project activity is for captive consumption by the project proponent. K 73
Wheeling agreement is signed between PP and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited
(BESCOM), H 25 Wheeling agreement is signed between PP and Chamundeshwari Electricity
Supply Corporation Limited. 

The project activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for generating power which
otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil
fuel based thermal power plants.The estimated annual average and the total CO2e emission reduction
by the project activity is expected to be 4,943t/CO2, whereas actual emission reduction achieved
during the first CoU period shall be submitted as a part of first monitoring and verification.
